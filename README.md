# Blender_SMB_LZ_Exporter

This is a Blender addon that exports into the raw LZ format for Super Monkey Ball and Super Monkey Ball 2. It is using the LZ specification reverse engineered by Yoshimaster96.

The goal of this addon is the ability to add animations to a custom level which is not currently possible without manually editing the LZ. The addon should also make it easier to go from having a level to playing it in-game.
