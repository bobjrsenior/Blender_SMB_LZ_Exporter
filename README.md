# Blender_SMB_LZ_Exporter

This is a Blender addon that exports into the raw LZ format for Super Monkey Ball and Super Monkey Ball 2. It is using the LZ specification reverse engineered by Yoshimaster96.

The goal of this addon is the ability to add animations to a custom level which is not currently possible without manually editing the LZ. The addon should also make it easier to go from having a level to playing it in-game.

## Testing

1. Open the TestLevel.blend file in Blender
2. Open the script in the Text Editor window
3. Click Run Script in the Text Editor window
4. In the Info or 3D View (or probably some others) windows, press space
5. Type SMB and select  Export SMB LZ from the list
6. Choose a save location for the LZ file
